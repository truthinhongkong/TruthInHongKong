We can never get the full story of what happend in Hongkong from the media. Please share what you know here with everybody.

## Background

On February 17, 2018, a Hongkonger named Chan Tong-kai bloodily murdered his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan and then escaped to Hongkong. The Hongkong police arrested him for murder after his admission on March 13, 2018- the day that Taiwanese authorities found his girlfriend's decomposed body. But he was only charged with money laundering and has not been sent to Taiwan, despite requests from the island authorities, because there is no formal extradition agreement between the two places. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, while the punishment for money laundering is capped at 14 years in prison and a HK$5 million fine.
Chan pleaded guilty to four counts of dealing with property known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence at the first available opportunity during committal proceedings at Eastern Court on December 31. So the Hongkong government wants to change its former bill to include Taiwan into its extraditable regions. However, mainland China is also on the list with Taiwan. Then come this mass and lasting violent protest.
